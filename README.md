# Simple Student Portal (HTML & CSS)

This is a minimal, static web application designed to demonstrate a basic student roster or portal view using only HTML structure and CSS styling.

## Features

*   **Student Roster:** Displays essential information (ID, Name, Grade, Major, Status) in a clear table format.
*   **Responsive Design:** Basic use of `max-width` to constrain the layout.
*   **Clear Styling:** Uses basic colors, padding, and hover effects for enhanced readability (zebra striping on the table).
*   **Status Indicators:** Visually highlights active and inactive student statuses using color codes.

## Usage

1.  Clone or download the repository.
2.  Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

No server or complex setup is required as this is a purely static front-end application.
